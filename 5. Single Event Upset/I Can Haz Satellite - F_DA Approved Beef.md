The web application allowed interaction with the remote system through numerous commands.  The most useful were: `fileManager.ShellCommand`, `fileDownlink.SendFile`, and the interface to access the downlink to download remote files.  The ShellCommand could run shell commands with the output saved as a text file.  The output could be sent using the fileDownlink command and downloaded locally to review the output.  The team used this to run shell commands and gather data such as process listings, directory walks, and capture other local files such as `/run_space.sh` which launched the program environment.

```
[23-May-22 16:05:54] ichs3 > cat run_space.sh
cat: run_space.sh: No such file or directory
echo "Starting spacecraft"
cd /home/space/fsw/
echo "${FLAG}" > /home/space/fsw/.FlagData
unset FLAG
sleep 15
./satellite.exe -a 172.16.238.3 -p 50000
```

As seen above, the shell script used the `FLAG` environment variable.  We were able to access the flag by using `cat /proc/1/environ` to get the Shell Environment for the main initializing processâ€™s PID.
